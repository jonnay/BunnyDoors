*** Serialized Doors File

	This is the file that is used to store the locked doors.  You shouldn't need to edit this directly, but its format is presented for
	those who are interested.

#+begin_src yaml :tangle src/main/resources/serializedDoors.yml
  # DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
  # YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
  # x575y66z-479Wworld
  #   locker: jonnay23
  #   key: theif 
  #  
#+end_src

	Basically each root node is named x<xpos>y<ypos>z<zpos>W<world> which is the ID of the door (the bottom block of the door). The 2
	sub nodes are the locker of the door (the player who did the /lock command) and the key used to lock the door.
